            <p>Crop disease detection has traditionally been conducted through manual inspections which are often 
                time-consuming, labor-intensive. Recent advancements have introduced remote sensing technology, 
                including the use of drones (UAVs), to overcome these limitations. Drones equipped with 
                multispectral, thermal, and RGB cameras can capture images, enabling the detection of early 
                signs of disease stress. The use of drones for monitoring plant health, emphasizing early 
                disease detection and targeted interventions to lesser the use of pesticides. while drones 
                have been employed in large-scale agriculture, there is still a gap in optimizing real-time 
                data analysis and integrating actionable insights with easily learnable mapping techniques 
                for small and medium-sized farms. The proposed system aims to address these limitations by 
                combining UAV surveillance with machine learning models for precise, real-time detection, 
                improving sustainability and diagnosis of crop diseases, offering a more scalable, 
                affordable and efficient solution.</p>
